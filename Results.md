# Some results

## Task Description
As a test task, we were asked to implement an LLM-based AI agent that automatically fixes buggy Python code. The quality of the agent was evaluated using the Python subset of **HumanEvalPack**.

---

## Agent Implementation

### Data
The HumanEvalFix is the union is some columns of HumanEvalPack (declaration + buggy_solution).
I used the (prompt + buggy_solution) (where prompt additionally includes the docstring)
As I wanted to see as many correct solutions as possible (to verify that agent is working correctly), and later use declaration as in the original paper)

### Framework
I implemented the agent using the **LangGraph** framework, which provides an easy-to-use scaffold for agentic workflows. I decided to avoid an excessively complex for this task implementation with implicit task creation as the goal is to get just a ReAct-style agent (Reason → Action → Observation pipeline with opportunity for the agent to call tools)

### Agent Scaffold
The agent follows a **ReAct-style architecture**, allowing it to:
- Reason about the buggy code
- Act using a **code interpreter tool** in a sandboxed environment  
This ensures that LLM-generated code is safely executed without side effects.
  (it would be more efficient to integrate the )

### Language Model
For the LLM, I used **Qwen3-0.6B**, an open-source model that is lightweight and can be served with limited computational resources.

## Evaluation

- unfortunately I didn't manage to reach these steps to provide the scores (the model manages to solve the problem (fix the bug), and to run the tests (based on the model outputs; print-debugging doesn't display this) but the finalize_solution (submitting the fixed code) isn't happening). Trying to retrieve the solution with regex didn't help neither)

## Issues

I didn't manage to find out the correct format of prompt and force the model to follow it. And each test run took plenty of time so number of attempts wasn't sufficient. (in the documentation and guides I also didn't find it)

## Result:

The model comes up with such result after some (large) number of not very valuable thoughts:
 "Thought": "All tests have passed. I will finalize the fixed function.",

 "action": "finalize_solution",
 "action_input": {
    "code": 
     from typing import List 
     def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
        """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than          given threshold.
            >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
            False
            >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
            True
        """
        for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
            for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
                if idx!= idx2:
                    distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    if distance < threshold:
                        return True\\n\\n       
                    return False
    }
 (that's the correct solution. Sadly, no useful data could be retrieved and collected)
