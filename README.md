# ReAct Python Bug-Fixing Agent

This project implements a **ReAct-style agent** that automatically fixes buggy Python functions and verifies them against tests.
The agent uses a sandboxed environment for safe execution and can run **fully offline** after setup.

## Features

- Automatic bug-fixing for Python functions
- Sandbox execution with `RestrictedPython`
- Iterative testing and reasoning with a ReAct agent
- Works offline after initial setup
